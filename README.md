#### Partial : button is not associate to form, required fields are not required, terms should be checkbox not radio button 
Duplicate the form depicted in the included image. Note the following:

* Use placeholders (hints) where shown
* Make First and Last name required, as well as the checkbox for agreeing to the terms
* Use the proper 'type' field for ```email```, ```password```, and ```birthday``` and make them *required* fields in the form
* Style as close to the example as you can but feel free to add additional styling (as it is quite the boring form...)
